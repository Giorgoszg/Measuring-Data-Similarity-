In this assignment we will implement a simple workflow that will assess the similarity between supermarket customers. 
The workflow will be used to compute, and suggest for any input customer, a list of his/her 10 most similar other customers. 
Moreover, we will be using these results to predict the rating of a customer. 
To calculate the (dis)similarity between customers we will first compute the dissimilarity for every given attribute as discussed in lecture “Measuring Data Similarity” .
