In this assignment we will implement a simple workflow that will assess the similarity between supermarket customers. 
The workflow will be used to compute, and suggest for any input customer, a list of his/her 10 most similar other customers. 
Moreover, we will be using these results to predict the rating of a customer. 
To calculate the (dis)similarity between customers we will first compute the dissimilarity for every given attribute as discussed in lecture “Measuring Data Similarity” .

Description of the available attributes:

Customer ID: The unique id of the customer.
Age: The age of the customer.
Sex: Male-Female.
Marital Status: Married, Single, Divorced.
Education: Primary, Secondary, Tertiary.
Annual Income: The annual customer income.
Customer Rating: The rating of the supermarket from the customer (Poor, Fair, Good, Very Good, Excellent).
Persons in Household: Number of persons in the household.
Occupation: The occupation of each customer (retired, housemaid, unemployed, management, entrepreneur, blue-collar, self-employed, services, technician).
